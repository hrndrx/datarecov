Our Business Model
At Reclaim Data Services, we serve as your trusted local bridge to world-class U.S. data recovery solutions. Whether you're dealing with an accidentally formatted hard drive, a failed SSD, or an unreadable external disk, we manage every step of the recovery process—securely, professionally, and with you in full control.
Here’s how our process works:
1. Consultation & Device Submission
You begin by consulting with our local team. Once you're ready to proceed, we arrange for you to send us your device. After receiving it, and with your written consent, we manage the entire international logistics process on your behalf—ensuring your device is securely prepared for dispatch to our official data recovery partner, SalvageData Recovery in the United States.
2. Secure International Shipping
Your device is shipped using a trusted courier service—such as FedEx, UPS, or DHL—ensuring careful handling, secure transport, and full tracking visibility from start to finish.
3. Free Evaluation & Transparent Quotation
Once your device reaches SalvageData's certified U.S. lab, it undergoes a thorough diagnostic evaluation, which is free in most cases. After analysis, a detailed quotation is sent directly to you, outlining the cost of recovery. You remain in full control—no recovery begins without your approval.
4. Professional Recovery Begins
Upon your approval and payment, the recovery process is initiated within a secure cleanroom environment by certified data recovery specialists. SalvageData uses advanced tools and techniques to retrieve your data safely and efficiently.
5. Return of Your Data and Device
Once the recovery is complete, your retrieved data is transferred to a brand-new storage device of your preferred size. Both the new device (with your recovered data) and your original or damaged device are then securely shipped back to you.
