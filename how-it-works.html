      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>At Reclaim My Data, we make professional data recovery easy, secure, and stress-free—while giving you full visibility and control. We connect you directly to SalvageData Recovery, a leading U.S. data recovery lab with ISO-certified cleanrooms, cutting-edge technology, and one of the highest success rates in the industry.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Local Consultation & Device Submission:</strong> You begin with a simple consultation with our local team. After assessing your situation and the nature of the data loss, we arrange for you to submit your device to us. You’ll remain in control every step of the way, and your written consent is always required before any shipping occurs.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure International Logistics:</strong> Once we receive your device and your shipping approval, we take over the logistics. Your device is professionally packaged and shipped using trusted global couriers such as FedEx, DHL, or UPS, ensuring maximum security, proper handling, and complete tracking from origin to destination.</li>
        <li><strong>Expert Evaluation & Quote:</strong> Upon arrival at SalvageData’s secure U.S. lab, your device undergoes a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation. In most cases, this evaluation is completely free. Once complete, you will receive a clear, transparent recovery quote—with no hidden fees. At this stage, you decide whether or not to proceed.</li>
        <li><strong>Recovery With Client Approval:</strong> Recovery only begins after you approve the quote and make payment. No work is done without your explicit authorization. SalvageData’s certified engineers then begin the recovery process using industry-leading tools in a Class 100 cleanroom environment, ensuring the safest and most efficient data retrieval possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Delivery of Recovered Data:</strong> Once the recovery is successful, your data is transferred to a brand-new storage device of your preferred capacity, and shipped back to you securely—alongside your original device (even if damaged). Everything is done with care, confidentiality, and attention to detail.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>At Reclaim My Data, we handle the complexity so you don’t have to. You stay informed, protected, and in control—from the moment you consult with us to the moment your data is safely back in your hands.</p>
