        <h3>How does your recovery process work?</h3>
        <p>We act as your local connection to world-class U.S. data recovery. You consult us locally, we handle the logistics of shipping your device to our U.S. partner (SalvageData Recovery USA), and they perform the recovery in their certified lab. We then return your data and device to you.</p>
