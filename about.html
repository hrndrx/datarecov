        <li><strong>Evaluation & Quote:</strong> You receive an evaluation (free in many cases) and a quote.</li>
        <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> Upon your approval, recovery begins.</li>
        <li><strong>Return:</strong> The recovered data and/or drive is securely shipped back to you.</li>
      </ol>
